abstract: Abstract The very high theoretical specific energy of the lithium–air (Li–O2)
  battery (3500 Wh kg−1) compared with other batteries makes it potentially attractive,
  especially for the electrification of flight. While progress has been made in realizing
  the Li–air battery, several challenges remain. One such challenge is achieving a
  high capacity to store charge at the positive electrode at practical current densities,
  without which Li–air batteries will not outperform lithium-ion. The capacity is
  limited by the mass transport of O2 throughout the porous carbon positive electrode.
  Here it is shown that by replacing the binder in the electrode by a polymer with
  the intrinsic ability to transport O2, it is possible to reach capacities as high
  as 31 mAh cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 in a 300 µm thick electrode. This corresponds to a positive
  electrode energy density of 2650 Wh L−1 and specific energy of 1716 Wh kg−1, exceeding
  significantly Li-ion batteries and previously reported Li–O2 cells. Due to the enhanced
  oxygen diffusion imparted by the gas diffusion polymer, Li2O2 (the product of O2
  reduction on discharge) fills a greater volume fraction of the electrode and is
  more homogeneously distributed.
