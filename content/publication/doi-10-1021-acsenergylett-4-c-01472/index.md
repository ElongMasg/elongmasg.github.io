abstract: ' Large interfacial resistance is a widely recognized impediment to the
  advancement of high-voltage, all-solid-state batteries. However, a comprehensive
  understanding of the fundamental cause behind the interfacial resistance between
  solid electrolytes and typical layered oxide cathodes has not yet been achieved.
  Here, we investigated the high-voltage stability of Li3InCl6 and elucidated the
  underlying interfacial electrochemical reactions between LiCoO2 and Li3InCl6. The
  pairing of Li3InCl6 with LiCoO2 exhibited a superior capacity retention of 73.6%
  even at 5.2 V, much higher than 28.2% charged at 4.6 V in lithium-ion batteries
  after 70 cycles. The enhanced high-voltage stability of ASSBs is attributed to the
  stable interface formed between LiCoO2 and Li3InCl6 and the reinforced surface and
  bulk structure stability. On the other hand, the ultrahigh voltage still causes
  the partial decomposition of Li3InCl6 and generates interfacial compounds such as
  InClO and cobalt and indium chlorides/oxides. '
