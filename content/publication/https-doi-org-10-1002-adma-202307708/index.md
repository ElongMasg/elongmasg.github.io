abstract: Abstract Aqueous zinc electrolytes offer the potential for cheaper rechargeable
  batteries due to their safe compatibility with the high capacity metal anode; yet,
  they are stymied by irregular zinc deposition and consequent dendrite growth. Suppressing
  dendrite formation by tailoring the electrolyte is a proven approach from lithium
  batteries; yet, the underlying mechanistic understanding that guides such tailoring
  does not necessarily directly translate from one system to the other. Here, it is
  shown that the electrostatic shielding mechanism, a fundamental concept in electrolyte
  engineering for stable metal anodes, has different consequences for the plating
  morphology in aqueous zinc batteries. Operando electrochemical transmission electron
  microscopy is used to directly observe the zinc nucleation and growth under different
  electrolyte compositions and reveal that electrostatic shielding additive suppresses
  dendrites by inhibiting secondary zinc nucleation along the (100) edges of existing
  primary deposits and encouraging preferential deposition on the (002) faces, leading
  to a dense and block-like zinc morphology. The strong influence of the crystallography
  of Zn on the electrostatic shielding mechanism is further confirmed with Zn||Ti
  cells and density functional theory modeling. This work demonstrates the importance
  of considering the unique aspects of the aqueous zinc battery system when using
  concepts from other battery chemistries.
