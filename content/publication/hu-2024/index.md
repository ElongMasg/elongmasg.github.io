abstract: Charging current densities of solid-state batteries with lithium metal anodes
  and ceramic electrolytes are severely limited due to lithium dendrites that penetrate
  the electrolyte leading to a short circuit. We show that dendrite growth can be
  inhibited by different crack deflection mechanisms when multi-layered solid electrolytes,
  such as Li6PS5Cl/Li3ScCl6/Li6PS5Cl and Li6PS5Cl/Li10GeP2S12/Li6PS5Cl, are employed
  but not when the inner layer is Li3PS4. X-ray tomographic imaging shows crack deflection
  along mechanically weak interfaces between solid electrolytes as a result of local
  mismatches in elastic moduli. Cracks are also deflected laterally within Li3ScCl6,
  which contains preferentially oriented particles. Deflection occurs without lithium
  being present. In cases where the inner layers react with lithium, the resulting
  decomposition products can fill and block crack propagation. All three mechanisms
  are effective at low stack pressures. Operating at 2.5 MPa, multi-layered solid
  electrolytes Li6PS5Cl/Li3ScCl6/Li6PS5Cl and Li6PS5Cl/Li10GeP2S12/Li6PS5Cl can achieve
  lithium plating at current densities exceeding 15 mA cm?2.
