abstract: 'Research into metal--air batteries is spurred by the promise of high energy
  densities, often surpassing those of lithium-ion batteries. Despite this promise,
  the development of practical metal--air batteries is hampered by their poor reversibility.
  Current research has indicated that the mechanisms causing battery degradation typically
  involve multiple aspects: 1. Whether the limiting factor in the formation/decomposition
  of the discharge production (such as Li2O2, in Li--O2 batteries) is eâˆ’ or Li+, i.e.
  does the interface occur at the Li2O2/electrolyte or the electrode/Li2O2? 2. The
  continuous formation of production during discharge clogs the electrode pores, reducing
  the effective area of the cathode material and thereby diminishing the capacity
  of the metal-air battery. 3. The generation of intermediate active species at the
  cathode, such as superoxides, peroxides, and singlet oxygen (1O2), leads to corrosion
  of critical battery components, including the electrolyte and electrodes. This corrosion
  leads to the formation of numerous decomposition products that are challenging to
  decompose, further exacerbating battery degradation. This chapter will briefly introduce
  the basic mechanisms of metal--air batteries and give an overview of the causes
  of battery degradation. Strategies to mitigate degradation will be explored along
  with suggested research directions.'
