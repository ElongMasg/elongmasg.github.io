abstract: Abstract Sodium-oxygen battery has attracted tremendous interest due to
  its extraordinary theoretical specific energy (1605 Wh kg−1NaO2) and appealing element
  abundance. However, definite mechanistic factors governing efficient oxygen diffusion
  and consumption inside electrolyte-flooded air cathodes remain elusive thus precluding
  a true gas diffusion electrode capable of high discharge current (i.e., several
  mA cm−2) and superior output power. Herein, 3D-printing technology is adopted to
  create gas channels with tailored channel size and structure to demystify the diffusion-limited
  oxygen delivery process. It is revealed that as the clogging discharging products
  increase, large channel size, and interconnected channel structure are essential
  to guaranteeing fast O2 diffusion. Moreover, to further encourage O2 diffusion,
  a bio-inspired breathable cathode with progressively branching channels that balances
  between O2 passage and reaction is 3D printed. This elaborated 3D electrode allows
  a sodium-oxygen cell to deliver an impressive discharging current density of up
  to 4 mA cm−2 and an output power of 8.4 mW cm−2, giving rise to an outstanding capacity
  of 18.4 mAh cm−2. The unraveled mystery of oxygen delivery enabled by 3D printing
  points to a valuable roadmap for the rational design of metal-air batteries toward
  practical applications.
